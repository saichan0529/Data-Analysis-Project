# Data Analysis Project

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

The sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities has been collected by the data scientists at Big Mart. It has become common for malls and marts worldwide to keep track of their product sales data in order to predict future demand and manage their inventory. The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into consumer behaviour and to optimise product placement and promotions. Based on transactional data, identifying the items that are frequently purchased together and examining the relationships between different products, compare customers’ preferences between the outlets and scope of introducing the new products in outlets.
